    "# Excited states of NaI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this exercise, the focus will be on excited states. Excited states play a significant role in photochemistry. As you have heard in the previous tutorial, calculation of excited states and their properties requires different methods than for the ground state chemistry. For the excited states, the approximation of only one Slater determinant is usually not valid. Unlike Hartree-Fock, multiconfigurational methods do not restrict the wavefunction to a single Slater determinant, but allow it to be a priori a linear combination of multiple Slater determinants.\n",
    "On the side of DFT, TD-DFT can be used to compute the excited-state properties without calculating the excited state wavefunction explicitly. This is faster and easier to use than multiconfigurational methods, but the accuracy may be inferior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will calculate the excitation energies of the dissociation curve of the sodium iodide (NaI).\n",
    "This system has been studied via pump-probe spectroscopy by Ahmed Zewail, who received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1999 (J. Chem. Phys. 91, 7415 (1989), doi: 10.1063/1.457266). You will see that the ground state and the first excited singlet state will form an avoided crossing. We will investigate this reaction with TDDFT and CASSCF.\n",
